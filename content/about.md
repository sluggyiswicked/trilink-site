## Our Approach to AI in Accounting

### Practical AI with Human Oversight

Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly thrown around as buzzwords, but at TriLink, we truly understand its transformative power. We believe technology should enhance — not replace — human judgment. AI is conscientiously applied where it excels, with human oversight in the loop. We use AI to perform practical, high-value tasks within defined guardrails, accelerating workflows without compromising security or accuracy. Our clients can trust that every decision and adjustment is guided by experienced professionals, with AI serving as a support tool, not a substitute. This balanced approach allows us to deliver innovation while maintaining the integrity, reliability, and accountability upon which your business depends.
