  differentiators:
    title: "What Makes Our Approach Different"
    items:
      - title: "Integrated Financial & Operational Perspective"
        description: "Most strategy consultants lack deep financial expertise. Most accountants lack operational strategy experience. We bring both, ensuring your strategy is financially sound and operationally executable."

        description: "Strategy is worthless without execution. We create detailed action plans, provide ongoing support, and hold ourselves accountable for results."
      - title: "Right-Sized Engagements"
        description: "We're not a big consulting firm billing hundreds of hours for PowerPoint decks. We focus on practical, high-impact work that delivers results quickly."
      - title: "Build Capabilities, Don't Create Dependency"
        description: "Our goal is to strengthen your team and systems, not create ongoing dependence on consultants. We transfer knowledge and build internal capabilities."

  faq:
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    items:
      - question: "How is this different from general business consulting?"
        answer: "Most consultants focus on strategy OR operations. We integrate both with deep financial expertise. This means your growth strategies are financially sound, your operational improvements drive measurable financial results, and your financial systems support operational excellence."
      - question: "What size businesses do you work with?"
        answer: "We typically work with businesses generating $1M-$50M in annual revenue. Below $1M, you often need execution support more than strategy. Above $50M, you typically need specialized industry consultants or are ready for a CFO/COO."
      - question: "How long does a typical engagement last?"
        answer: "Initial assessment and strategy development: 1-3 months. Implementation support: 6-18 months depending on scope. Some clients engage us for ongoing strategic guidance (quarterly or monthly)."
      - question: "What's the time commitment from our team?"
        answer: "Expect 8-15 hours from leadership during assessment/strategy phase, then 2-5 hours weekly during implementation. We're efficient with your time but need engagement for successful outcomes."
      - question: "Do you implement the strategies you recommend?"
        answer: "We provide implementation support, project management, and accountability. We'll help you execute but won't become your operations team. For specialized implementations (software, marketing, etc.), we often collaborate with or recommend specialist partners."
      - question: "What if our situation changes mid-engagement?"
        answer: "Business is dynamic. We build flexibility into our engagements and adjust strategies as circumstances evolve. Monthly reviews ensure we're addressing current priorities, not outdated plans."
      - question: "How do you measure success?"
        answer: "We establish clear success metrics at the engagement start. Typical measures include revenue growth, margin improvement, cash flow strengthening, operational efficiency gains, and time freed for strategic work."
      - question: "What industries do you serve?"
        answer: "We work across industries but have particular depth in professional services, manufacturing, distribution, and technology companies. Our financial and operational expertise transfers across sectors."
